This is Quinn Eberhard's public repository for UNC BIOS 611: Introduction to Data Science

To build the report.pdf:
From the bios-611-project main directory, first run `make clean` and the n run `make report.pdf`

This should remove any potential residual information and then newly develop the report.pdf

As this is a large dataset, this may take awhile. Be prepared for this to load for several minutes.





Scientific Data Background Information:
I will be analyzing long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) data to try to better understand the relationship between lncRNA sequences and their functions. The datasets may evolve over the course, but initially I begin with the k-mer content values and expression from total and fractionated RNAseq, as well as Bruseq/Bruchase data for K562 cells from ENCODE.

For my preliminary "skeletal" analysis, I will look into the trends observed from the k-mer content of lncRNAs in the K562 cell data. These are segments of lncRNAs broken down into segments of length k, in this case, 6 nucleotides.
