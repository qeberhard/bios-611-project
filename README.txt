I will be analyzing long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) data to try to better understand the relationship between lncRNA sequences and their functions. The datasets may evolve over the course, but initially I begin with the k-mer content values and expression from total and fractionated RNAseq, as well as Bruseq/Bruchase data for K562 cells from ENCODE.
